# Matplotlib Basics Learning

## üìö Introduction

Welcome to my **Matplotlib Basics** learning repository! üöÄ

In this repository, I showcase my journey of learning **Matplotlib**, a widely-used library in Python for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. 
Matplotlib is a low-level plotting library that provides a wide range of features for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. It is the most widely used data visualization library in Python, and it is known for its flexibility and power.
I‚Äôve covered the fundamental concepts of Matplotlib through various problems and examples.

## üí° Concepts Covered

This repository contains the basics of **Matplotlib**, focusing on essential visualization techniques. Here's a brief overview of the core topics I‚Äôve covered:

### 1. Matplotlib Intro
Overview of what Matplotlib is, its purpose in data visualization, and common use cases.

### 2. Matplotlib Get Started
Installation steps, environment setup, and writing your first basic plot using `pyplot`.

### 3. Matplotlib Pyplot
Understanding `matplotlib.pyplot`, the functional interface for building plots interactively like MATLAB.

### 4. Matplotlib Plotting
Creating simple and multiple line plots using the `plot()` function with different datasets.

### 5. Matplotlib Markers
Customizing data point markers using shape, size, and color options to enhance readability.

### 6. Matplotlib Line
Line formatting techniques including style (`--`, `-.`, `:`), width, and color customization.

### 7. Matplotlib Labels
Adding titles, axis labels, and legends to make your plots more informative and presentable.

### 8. Matplotlib Grid
Enhancing visual clarity by displaying grid lines using the `grid()` function.

### 9. Matplotlib Subplot
Creating multiple plots in a single figure using `subplot()` for comparative visual analysis.

### 10. Matplotlib Scatter
Generating scatter plots with the `scatter()` function to observe correlation and clusters.

### 11. Matplotlib Bars
Designing bar charts using `bar()` to represent categorical data effectively.

### 12. Matplotlib Histograms
Visualizing data distribution using `hist()` by grouping values into bins.

### 13. Matplotlib Pie Charts
Creating pie charts using `pie()` to illustrate proportions in a dataset.

## üìù Short Descriptions

### 1. **Line Plots**
   - **Description**: Line plots are one of the most basic types of plots. They are used to display data points connected by straight lines. It's commonly used for time series or trend analysis.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     y = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
     plt.plot(x, y)
     plt.show()
     ```

### 2. **Scatter Plots**
   - **Description**: Scatter plots are used to display values for two continuous variables. Each point represents a value on the X and Y axes. It's useful for observing relationships between variables.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     plt.scatter(x, y)
     plt.show()
     ```

### 3. **Bar Plots**
   - **Description**: Bar plots are used to show comparisons between categories. It is often used for categorical data visualization.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     categories = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
     values = [10, 20, 15, 30]
     plt.bar(categories, values)
     plt.show()
     ```

### 4. **Histograms**
   - **Description**: A histogram is a type of plot that is used to represent the frequency distribution of a dataset. It shows how data is distributed over a continuous interval.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7]
     plt.hist(data, bins=5)
     plt.show()
     ```

### 5. **Pie Charts**
   - **Description**: Pie charts are circular charts that are divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions. It's often used to represent percentages of a whole.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     labels = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'JavaScript']
     sizes = [40, 30, 15, 15]
     plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%')
     plt.show()
     ```

### 6. **Subplots**
   - **Description**: Subplots are used to create multiple plots in a single figure. This allows you to display several related plots side by side for easy comparison.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
     plt.plot(x, y)
     plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
     plt.bar(categories, values)
     plt.show()
     ```

### 7. **Customizing Plots**
   - **Description**: Matplotlib allows a variety of customization options such as adding titles, labels, legends, changing colors, and adjusting styles to make plots more informative and visually appealing.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     plt.plot(x, y, label='Line Plot')
     plt.title('Basic Line Plot')
     plt.xlabel('X-axis')
     plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
     plt.legend()
     plt.show()
     ```
